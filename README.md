## 2. Data Collection
The projected rent and income calculations were based off historical census data. The average monthly rent costs were dated from 1992 to 2019. From these, we extrapolated growth rates and the rates of the growth rates to find the most accurate projected growth. Each one was applied annually until the United Nations' target year of 2030.

Median income data was shown from 2005 to 2015. The growth rate is estimated as there is no annual data supplied between the two years in the dataset. The same process was applied to estimate the growth rate.
