    "text": "As GIS students, we wanted to offer more to the table than a map for people to interpret. Therefore, we used the resources provided by ESRI to create a story and convey an urgent problem to people who use our app. We realized that not every person or user of an application has map interpreting skills, so we included write-ups, interactive maps, and communicative infographics to gear towards users with basic or no GIS knowledge. For those with GIS knowledge, the app provides resources and information that fosters a feeling of urgency and desire to take action."
